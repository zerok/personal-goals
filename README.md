# Personal goals

Personal goals in the open.

Why? I've been posting yearly reviews for quite some time now but did were just that: Snapshots. With this I want to have a living documentation on what I want to accomplish. This being versioned and accessible where ever I am is just a bonus.

## What's in here?

* [Places I want to visit](places.md)
* [Dishes I want to try](dishes.md)

### Goals

* [2019](goals/2019.md)
* [2017](goals/2017.md)
* [2016](goals/2016.md)

### Content lists

Here are movies, TV shows, podcasts and much more what I've "consumed" over the years but also those that I really want to enjoy but haven't yet found the time for.

* [ðŸ“š Books](content-list/books.md)
* [ðŸŽ® Games](content-list/games.md)
* [ðŸ“º TV](content-list/television.md)
