… means that I’m currently in the process of watching this season.

## Caught up

All the shows that are still being produced but have no new episodes on Netflix or Amazon.

## Abandoned

| Name | Made it until | Reason(s) |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Bosch | 1.3 (2017) | Not bad but with other shows like *The Blacklist* and others around I simply couldn't find the time for this one. |
| Penny Dreadful | 2.5 (2016) | Just not for me. |
| Sense8 | Season 1 finale (2016) | I tries to catch up but for some reason I couldn't even get past the first ten minutes of the Christmas-special. That was a sign for me that I should perhaps watch something else... |
