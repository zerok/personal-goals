# 2017

- [x] Get a life: I have a girlfriend, I go on trips to cities without there
  being a conference. I think that should be enough for now ðŸ˜‰
- [ ] Less grumpy: This is a bit complicated. During the first half of the year
  I suffered from some mental health issues which are still lingering around.
  As such, being "grumpy" is perhaps the least of my problems right now ðŸ˜‰
- [x] Deeper knowledge: Focusing on Go but also diving once again into VIM et
  al. has helped here quite a lot.
- [x] Even more writing: While I probably won't be able to write as many blog
  posts this year as I did in 2016, I've written quite a lot on other platforms
  and also internally at work.
- [x] Become an Angel and/or contribute more: I'm now much more active when it
  comes to reporting bugs/feature-requests and also contributing code. I'm also
  donating a bit every month to projects I'm using day-in and day-out.
